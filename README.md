# Office microbes
Notebooks and code for our Sloan office microbiome project.

The draft paper is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ps__dRQZOqjwMqYOSHAzqt7NXNUnJ2G6mVw4Jb-f-Pk/edit#). 

To get started using this code:
 1. create a conda enviornment for the project: ``conda create -c https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda -n office-microbes python=3.4 scikit-bio; source activate office-microbes``
 2. clone the repository: ``git clone git@github.com:gregcaporaso/office-microbes.git``
 3. change to the resulting directory: ``cd office-microbes``
 4. run: ``pip install -e .``
 5. create a directory where you'll work named after your GitHub username, e.g., ``mkdir gregcaporaso``
 6. and change to that directory and start working on your IPython Notebooks. 

The filepaths listed below will be useful for getting started, as these are generally the data files that you'll want to work with.
